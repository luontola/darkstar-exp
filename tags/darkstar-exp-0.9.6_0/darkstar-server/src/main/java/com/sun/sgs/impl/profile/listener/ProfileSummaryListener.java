/**
 * A text-output listener that generates task-periodic summary reports
 * about the performance of tasks being executed by a server.  Each
 * report summaries a fixed number of tasks.  The number of tasks
 * summarized can be modified by setting the {@code
 * com.sun.sgs.profile.listener.window.size} property in the system
 * properties.  The default number of tasks is {@code 5000}.
 *
 * <p>
 * 
 * Each report is structured like the following example:
 * <p><pre>
 * past 5000 tasks:
 *   mean: 2.94ms,  max: 21ms,  failed 25 (0.50%),
 *   mean ready count: 4.09,  mean lag time: 11.87ms, 
 *   parallelism factor: 0.99
 *   mean throughput: 88 txn/sec,  mean latency: 32.14 ms/txn
 * all 104302000 tasks:
 *   mean: 2.64ms,  max: 1010ms,  failed 1713 (0.62%),
 *   mean ready count: 3.98,  mean lag time: 9.75ms
 *   mean throughput: 88 txn/sec,  mean latency: 32.14 ms/txn
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 *
 * Note that the mean, max, mean throughput, and mean latency reports only
 * apply to successful tasks.
