Version 0.9.6:
- Support multi-node operation
  - Add WatchdogService and NodeMappingService
  - Modify the TaskService, ChannelService, and ClientSessionService to
    use the new services
- API changes:
  - Use ByteBuffer for channel and session message parameters
  - Remove subset channel sends
  - Make ClientSession and Channel managed objects
  - Add Channel message filtering
  - Loosen consistency guarantees for obtaining channel sessions
  - Add exceptions for resource failures
  - Make miscellaneous channel convenience changes
  - Add new Delivery constant
  - Add type parameter to ManagedReference
- Implement ManagedReferenceImpl.equals and hashCode
- Remove support for running multiple applications
- Detect managed objects with serialization readResolve or writeReplace
  methods
- Simplify scheduler and kernel interfaces
- Simplify SGS protocol
- Increase default BDB data store cache size

Version 0.9.5:
- Improve I/O throttling in the Client Session and Channel services
- Add scalable map and set implementations
- Add ManagedObjectRemoval interface
- Modify Transaction.checkTimeout to abort timed-out transactions

Version 0.9.4:
- Fix a bug that caused timeout exceptions that occurred when
  deserializing managed references to not be retried
- Modify TCP connection establishment to disable Nagle's Algorithm,
  to reduce latency

Version 0.9.3:
- Document the network protocol and public server configuration
  properties
- Perform service and application initialization with an unbounded
  transaction timeout
- Reduce the default task transaction timeout to 100 ms
- Modify the ClientSessionService to use the CompactId representation
  for session IDs in protocol messages -- this is an incompatible
  network format change
- Modify the DataService to
  - Compress object data by storing class descriptors separately -- this
    is an incompatible database format change
  - Log information about modified objects that are not marked for
    update
  - Add support for a thread that periodically checkpoints the database,
    and for automatically removing database log files
  - Improve handling of exceptions thrown by managed object toString
    methods

  if the initial server connection failed
- Use a compact format for channel identifiers
- Implement an initial multi-node version of the DataService
- Update profiling to include information about transaction
  participants, and to include object and byte counts

Version 0.9.1:

  out-of-order
- Improve channel message delivery performance
