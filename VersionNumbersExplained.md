# Darkstar EXP's Version Numbers #

The version numbering scheme is based on the version numbers of the vanilla Project Darkstar on which the EXP version is based on. In addition to that, there is a number representing the version of EXP, if more than one EXP version is based on the same vanilla version.

To illustrate:

  1. Darkstar 0.9.6 is the original unmodified version
  1. Darkstar EXP 0.9.6\_0 is based on Darkstar 0.9.6 without any new features
  1. Darkstar EXP 0.9.6\_1 is based on Darkstar EXP 0.9.6\_0 with some features added
  1. Darkstar EXP 0.9.6\_2 is based on Darkstar EXP 0.9.6\_1 with some more features added
  1. The original Project Darkstar team releases Darkstar 0.9.7
  1. Darkstar EXP 0.9.7\_0 is based on Darkstar 0.9.7 without any new features
  1. Darkstar EXP 0.9.7\_1 is based on Darkstar EXP 0.9.7\_0 with all the previous new features merged from Darkstar EXP 0.9.6\_2
